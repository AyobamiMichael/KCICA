# Kernel-based Contrastive Independent Component Analysis (KCICA)

This repository contains an implementation of **Kernel-based Contrastive Independent Component Analysis (KCICA)** using PyTorch. The goal of this model is to separate mixed signals into their independent components by minimizing a contrastive loss function based on the **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**. This technique is particularly useful for unsupervised learning tasks such as blind source separation, feature extraction, and anomaly detection.

## Overview

The KCICA model is a neural network-based approach for separating mixed signals into their independent components. It uses a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to capture nonlinear relationships in the data and a contrastive HSIC loss to ensure that the recovered components are independent and distinct from negative samples.

### Key Components
- **RBF Kernel**: Computes the similarity between data points using a Gaussian kernel.
- **HSIC Loss**: Measures the independence between two sets of features using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.
- **Neural Network**: A simple feedforward network with one hidden layer for learning the transformation.

## Key Features
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Does not require labeled data.
- **Nonlinear Separation**: Captures complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Uses negative samples to improve the separation of independent components.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Easy to integrate with other PyTorch-based workflows.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python and PyTorch installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kcica.git
    cd kcica
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install torch
    ```

3. Run the code:
    ```bash
    python kcica.py
    ```

## Usage

### Simulated Example
The code includes a simulated example where mixed signals are separated into their independent components. Here's how to use it:

1. **Define the Model**:
    ```python
    model = KCICA(input_dim=5, output_dim=5).to(device)
    ```

2. **Set Up the Optimizer**:
    ```python
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    ```

3. **Train the Model**:
    ```python
    for epoch in range(1000):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        S = model(X)  # Recovered sources
        loss = hsic_loss(S, S) - hsic_loss(S, neg_samples)  # Contrastive HSIC Loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    ```

4. **Monitor Training**:
    The loss is printed every 100 epochs to track the training progress.

## Real-World Applications

The KCICA model can be applied to various real-world problems, including:
- **Blind Source Separation**: Separating mixed audio signals or biomedical signals.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in data.
- **Signal Denoising**: Removing noise from signals while preserving the underlying structure.
