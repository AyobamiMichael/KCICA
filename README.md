Kernel-based Contrastive Independent Component Analysis (KCICA)
This repository contains an implementation of Kernel-based Contrastive Independent Component Analysis (KCICA) using PyTorch. The goal of this model is to separate mixed signals into their independent components by minimizing a contrastive loss function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This technique is particularly useful for unsupervised learning tasks such as blind source separation, feature extraction, and anomaly detection.

Overview
The KCICA model is a neural network-based approach for separating mixed signals into their independent components. It uses a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to capture nonlinear relationships in the data and a contrastive HSIC loss to ensure that the recovered components are independent and distinct from negative samples.

Key Components
RBF Kernel: Computes the similarity between data points using a Gaussian kernel.

HSIC Loss: Measures the independence between two sets of features using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.

Neural Network: A simple feedforward network with one hidden layer for learning the transformation.

Key Features
Unsupervised Learning: Does not require labeled data.

Nonlinear Separation: Captures complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.

Contrastive Learning: Uses negative samples to improve the separation of independent components.

PyTorch Implementation: Easy to integrate with other PyTorch-based workflows.

Installation
To use this code, you need to have Python and PyTorch installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kcica.git
cd kcica
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install torch
Run the code:

bash
Copy
python kcica.py
Usage
Simulated Example
The code includes a simulated example where mixed signals are separated into their independent components. Here's how to use it:

Define the Model:

python
Copy
model = KCICA(input_dim=5, output_dim=5).to(device)
Set Up the Optimizer:

python
Copy
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
Train the Model:

python
Copy
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    S = model(X)  # Recovered sources
    loss = hsic_loss(S, S) - hsic_loss(S, neg_samples)  # Contrastive HSIC Loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
Monitor Training:
The loss is printed every 100 epochs to track the training progress.

Real-World Applications
The KCICA model can be applied to various real-world problems, including:

Blind Source Separation: Separating mixed audio signals or biomedical signals.

Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in data.

Signal Denoising: Removing noise from signals while preserving the underlying structure.
